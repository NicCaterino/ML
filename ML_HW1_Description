This report delves into the task of selecting the most optimal classification model for two distinct datasets, each comprising approximately 50,000 samples.
Notably, the smaller dataset is characterized by a lower dimensionality, containing around 100 features, whereas its larger counterpart boasts 1000 features.
Crucially, the nature and representation of these datasets remain ambiguous, precluding any a priori assumptions within the hypothesis space. 
Consequently, the chosen classification algorithm will inherently contend with this uncertainty, influencing its performance and adaptability.

The primary challenge lies in navigating this uncharted territory, where the absence of predefined insights into the datasets' nature demands a versatile approach
to model selection. 
The diversity in feature dimensions presents an intriguing opportunity to explore the impact of varying dataset complexities on classification model efficacy without
prior domain knowledge.
